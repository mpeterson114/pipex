# üîó Pipex
> C program that replicates the shell's pipe '|' functionality. Implemented using C and various system calls, such as fork, pipe, dup2, and execve.

The mandatory portion of the program should mimick the behavior of the following shell command:

```< file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2```

while the bonus portion should behave like the following shell commands in handling multiple commands: 

```< file1 cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3 ... | cmdn > file2```

or in supporting ```<<``` and ```>>``` when the first parameter is ```here_doc```: 

```cmd << LIMITER | cmd1 >> file```



## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
### ‚ü° Mandatory Part
* Enter into the cloned repository and compile with ```make```

* Execute using the following syntax:
```
./pipex input_file cmd1 cmd2 output_file
```

* The output will be written to the specified output file. If the output file already exists, its contents will be overwritten.

### ‚ü° Bonus Part
* Inside the cloned repository, compile with ```make bonus```

* Execute with two or more commands:
```
./pipex_bonus input_file cmd1 cmd2 ... cmdN output_file
```
* You can also execute the bonus portion with a Heredoc:
```
./pipex_bonus here_doc LIMITER cmd1 cmd2 ... cmdN output_file
```
* You will then be prompted to input text which will be used as input for the commands. The result will be appended to the output file, rather than overwriting its contents.
